# Stream Processing Engine with Distributed OLAP Insights
This is a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed system designed to process high-throughput data streams while providing insightful analytics into Load Balancing and Scaling and Monitoring Distributed System Health through an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cube. The engine is optimized for real-time performance, load balancing, and fault tolerance, aligning with modern distributed system principles. Seamless integration with Amazon S3 ensures secure and scalable data storage for OLAP cubes.

## Features
- **Real-Time Stream Processing**:
    - Ingest and process high-throughput streams of data in real-time.
    - Support for sharding and partitioning for scalability.
- **Load Balancing and Scaling Insights**: 
    - Analyze the system's ability to distribute load efficiently across nodes.
    - Identify scaling needs dynamically to ensure optimal resource usage.
- **Fault Tolerance and Scalability**: 
    - Implements leaderless fault tolerance for high availability.
    - Dynamically scales to handle increased workloads, ensuring high performance even during peak traffic.
- **Analytics Dashboards**: 
    - Real-time load balancing and scaling metrics for monitoring trends and system health.
- **Distributed OLAP Cube**: 
    - Analyze data streams across multiple dimensions, latency, throughput, load distribution, and network performance.
    - Leverages Amazon S3 for efficient, scalable storage and querying.
    - Supports historical and real-time data analysis.
    - Query Examples:
        - "Which nodes in the cluster have the highest error rates?"
        - "What are the latency patterns for specific regions over time?"
        - "How does the load distribution vary across nodes and regions during peak traffic?"
        - "Which nodes are underutilized or overloaded in real-time?"
## Architecture Overview
- **Ingestion Layer (Java)**:
    - Kafka consumer to ingest data streams.
    - Ensures efficient partitioning for parallel processing.
- **Processing Layer (C++)**:
    - Implements core processing operations (filtering, transformations, aggregation).
    - Implements leaderless fault tolerance using quorum-based consistency.
    - Supports stream joins and windowing for complex analytics.
- **OLAP Cube Processing (C++)**:
    - Provides multi-dimensional analysis across metrics like latency, node performance, and network utilization.
    - Leverages Amazon S3 for efficient querying and scalability.
- **Monitoring (Java)**:
    - Real-time dashboards for monitoring system health, load distribution, and processing metrics.
    - Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for customizable alerts and visualizations.
## Key Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C++ and Java.
- **Stream Framework**: Kafka.
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for OLAP cube storage.
- **Coordination**: Zookeeper for distributed coordination.
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for real-time insights and Prometheus for metrics collection.
