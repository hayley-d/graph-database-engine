# Cybersecurity-Oriented Stream Processing Engine with S3 Integration
A real-time stream processing engine built for large-scale, cybersecurity-focused data analysis. Designed to identify and respond to security threats, process security logs, and enforce compliance regulations, the engine leverages leaderless fault tolerance and integrates seamlessly with Amazon S3 for secure, scalable data storage.



## Features
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Processes logs and network traffic to detect anomalies and potential security breaches.
- **Log Aggregation and Analysis**: Aggregates and analyses distributed logs for centralised security insights.
- **Leaderless Fault Tolerance**: Quorum-based consistency ensures high availability and reliability.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts processing nodes based on workload.
- **Data Encryption and Masking**: Ensures secure processing and storage of sensitive information.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Real-time security metrics for monitoring attack trends and system health.
- **Kafka Integration**: Efficient stream ingestion and inter-node communication.
- **AWS S3 Storage**: Secure and durable storage for processed security data.


## Architecture Overview
- **Ingestion Layer (Java)**:
    - Kafka consumer to ingest data streams.
    - Partitions data and assigns processing tasks to nodes.
- **Processing Layer (C++)**:
    - Implements core processing operations (filtering, transformations, aggregation).
    - Implements leaderless fault tolerance using quorum-based consistency.
- **Storage (AWS S3)**:
    - Durable and scalable data storage using AWS S3.
    - Encryption for sensitive information.
- **Monitoring (Java)**:
    - Real-time visualization of security metrics such as intrusion patterns and attack trends.
    - Alerts for suspicious activities or failures.
## 
### **Requirements**
- **C++ :**
    - Boost (networking and concurrency)
    - Kafka client library
    - Protobufs/gRPC
- **Java:**
    - spring boot
    - kafka client
    - prometheus (metrics collection)
    - grafana (vizulization)
- **AWS S3**
    - AWS SDK for C++/Java


## Usage
- **Submit Security Logs**: Send logs via Kafka for real-time analysis.
- **Detect Threats**: Automatically identifies anomalies and potential breaches.
- **View Metrics**: Use the monitoring dashboard to track security status and trends.
